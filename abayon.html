 <p style="color:#Black;">
    To play lawn tennis, two or four players use rackets to hit a ball over a net and into the opponentâ€™s court. The game starts with a serve, and players take turns hitting the ball back and forth, trying to land it within the boundaries while making it difficult for the opponent to return. Points are scored when a player fails to return the ball properly, and the first to win four points with at least a two-point lead wins a game. Matches are usually played in sets, with players needing to win six games (by a margin of two) to take a set.

 <p style="color:#Black;">
    To learn tennis, start with the basics like how to hold a racket, proper footwork, and simple strokes such as the forehand and backhand. Practice regularly on a court, either with a coach, partner, or against a wall. Focus on improving consistency, aim, and movement. Watching matches and following tutorials can also help you understand rules and strategies. With patience and practice, your skills will steadily improve.<br>Practice regularly on a court, either with a coach, partner, or against a wall.
